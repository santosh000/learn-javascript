                 //variable
                 // var, let, const
                 //var - we can set a variable globally.

                 //(globally scope,ex -let we have a condition and we set a variable.out side of that block if we have another variable with same name that can cause a issue thats why rare use.)

                 //let and const were add in es6(es2015) script

                 //let-wit this we can re assign value
                 //ex-
let age =28;
age=30;          //we can modify here
console.log(age);

                 //const - A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution. It cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.
const hi =28;
hi=40;           //can't change
const hi=40;     //can't change
console.log(hi);

                 //use const when you know and sure your gone re assign vale.its very robust and secure.
